The 012-28 Modern Deluxe is a new take on Martin Vintage. 

This twelve-fret guitar is packed with custom features and 

modern technology that you have to see, feel, and hear for yourself. 

The vintage appointments include a spruce VINTAGE TONE SYSTEM® top, 

a dovetail neck joint, and natural protein glue construction that giving 

it the rich, fully aged Martin tone that has inspired generations. 

The look is unlike anything in our production line with European flamed maple 

binding on the body, stylish gold frets, and a unique 1930s style 

script logo inlaid in pearl on the headstock. Some ultra-modern features 

include Liquidmetal® bridge pins with red dots and a composite carbon fiber 

bridgeplate that boosts volume, and a new neck shape that is slightly 

asymmetrical for maximum hand comfort up and down the fretboard.
