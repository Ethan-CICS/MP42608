Expression begins with the all valve OriginÂ® series.

It delivers two inbuilt voices, a new tilt control,

Powerstem our new power reduction technology and forms 

the perfect marriage with FX pedals.

The classically styled single channel amps generate rich 

and harmonic tones that are ideal 

for players to explore new possibilities and craft their sound.

There is a 2-way footswitch available with all models so you can control the 

gain boost and turn the FX loop on and off. 

The series has something for those playing in the bedroom, at rehearsal or on the stage.


Key Features:

A little extra boost.

Crank up the gain by using the pull boost feature. You can add a 

little extra grit and distortion to your sound. 

You have the power.

Our new power reducing technology,

Powerstem allows you to have high or low 

power modes without compromising on sound quality.  


What is Powerstem?

Powerstem works by reducing the voltage rails around the 

power amplifier rather than using our traditional pentode/triode reduction methods.

This offers power reduction without changing the sonic 

character and so provides optimum tone and performance 

regardless of the volume level required by guitarists.
