The Precision Bass neck is sleek, fast, and smooth thanks to its silky satin

finish, comfortable rolled edges on a 12” inch radius fingerboard, and

modern “C” backshape. A rock solid HiMass™ bridge provides sustain,

resonance, and perfect intonation. With classic Fender style, advanced

features and stunning new finishes, the Precision Bass is the perfect tool

to spark your creativity and stand out from the crowd.
