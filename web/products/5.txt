The Joe Dart II is the latest installment in the Joe Dart artist series

signature bass collection. The Dart II offers a classic passive tone within

a full-scale 34" package with its custom contoured body and simplified dual

single-coil layout. The bass features a premium ash body, select maple neck,

and passive split-coil pickups at the heart of its warm, punchy tonality.

Dual volume controls are standard, but there are no tone controls to color

the sound; therefore, the tone is manipulated solely by the user's technique

and finesse. It is finished in Natural Velvet, comes with 21 frets and a

custom artist series neckplate, and is tuned to E standard with custom gauge

.045 - .105" Ernie Ball stainless steel roundwound wound bass strings.
