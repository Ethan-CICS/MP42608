The VOX AC15 is the amp that started it all.

Boasting both a Normal and Top Boost channel, the AC15 Custom is an all-tube,

EL84 driven workhorse that delivers 15 watts 

of authentic British tone into your choice of

a genuine Celestion Greenback or Alnico Blue speaker.

The AC15 Custom also offers footswitchable spring reverb 

and classic VOX tremolo to enhance the already impressive sound.

Adored by the biggest names in music for nearly 60 years,

the VOX AC15 Custom carries on the tradition that began in 

1958 and offers guitarists the unmistakable sound of VOX, 

with all the refinements of a modern amplifier.
