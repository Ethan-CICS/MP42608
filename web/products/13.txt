The SYSTEM-8 is a direct result of over four decades of synthesizer 

development at Roland, including some of the most iconic instruments ever made.

It absolutely nails the sound and behavior of our most sought-after classics, 

like the included JUPITER-8, JUNO-106 

and JX-3P synthesizers and yet it does so much more. 

Mix and match modern and vintage oscillators and filter types with multiple 

dedicated effects then split and layer them into never-before-heard new sounds. 

Shape every detail with the huge array of high-resolution controls and create 

fully realized musical ideas with the onboard 

polyphonic sequencer with motion recording.
