The archetypical Fender Telecaster is a solid-body electric guitar with 

a flat asymmetric single-cutaway body; 

the body is usually made from alder or ash. 

The neck is usually made from maple and attached to the body with screws 

and has a distinctive small headstock with six tuning pegs mounted inline 

along a single side; the fingerboard may be maple or another wood, 

e.g. rosewood, and has at least twenty-one frets. 


The Telecaster's body is front-routed for electronics; 

the bridge pickup is mounted in a metal plate 

attached to the guitar's bridge, other pickups are mounted 

in a plastic pickguard, and the controls are mounted 

in a metal plate on the lower bout of the guitar. 

Most Telecasters have two single-coil pickups, 

a pickup selector switch, a single volume control 

and a single tone control. Fixed bridges are almost universal, and the 

original design has three individually adjustable dual-string saddles 

whose height and intonation can be set independently.
