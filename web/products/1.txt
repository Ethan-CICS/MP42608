The guitar introduced into the popular market several features 

that were innovative for electric guitars in the mid-1950s. 

The distinctive body shape, which has become commonplace among electric guitars, 

was revolutionary for the time period, and for the first time a mass-market 

electric guitar did not significantly resemble earlier acoustic models. 


The double cutaway, elongated horns, 

and heavily contoured back were all designed for better balance and 

comfort to play while standing up and slung off the shoulder with a strap. 


The three-pickup design offered players increased versatility and 

choice in tone quality over earlier one- and two-pickup electric guitars, 

and a responsive and simplified vibrato arm integrated into the bridge plate, 

which marked a significant design improvement over other 

vibrato systems, such as those manufactured by Bigsby. 


All of these design elements were popularized and later became an industry 

standard due to the success of the Stratocaster. 

The Fender Stratocaster is one of the most iconic electric guitar models 

of all time.
