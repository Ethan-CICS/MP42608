Originally released in 1970, Minimoog Model D was the 

world’s first portable synthesizer and served as the archetype 

for all electronic keyboards that followed. 

The all-analog instrument gained acclaim for combining the colossal 

sound of the 1960s Moog modular synthesizers with the accessibility of 

pre-wired modules—meaning that it could be played instantly and intuitively 

with no patch cables required.


The three-oscillator, monophonic, analog synthesizer is securely housed 

in a locally sourced Appalachian cherry cabinet and hand-finished aluminum chassis. 

Sounding as vibrant and deep as ever, its legendary low-pass ladder filter, 

powerful oscillators, and rich saturating mixer retain the exact component 

placement and through-hole design of a 1970s-era Minimoog Model D.
