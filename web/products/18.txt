The TremLord 30 is our very British take on a 1950s-style guitar amplifier.

With valve Tremolo, valve Reverb and a quartet of EL84s pushing 30 Watts,

it’s every retro sound you need in a compact 1×12 package. The beautifully simple,

non-master volume design is straight out of the golden age of Rock n' Roll but 15W, 

2W and 1W settings allow that coveted “sweet spot” to be

 enjoyed at more civilised volumes. 


Two independent, footswitchable Tremolo Speed controls, 

foot switchable Reverb and a valve-driven FX Loop 

also help bring this old-time tone machine firmly into the present day.
