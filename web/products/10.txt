PDP proudly brings you the Concept Series™ Drums, a completely 

re-imagined line of boutique-inspired drums, designed for every drummer. 

Designed by Drum Workshop in California with research assistance from the 

DW Custom Shop, Concept Series Drums have a fresh, new look, and a sound 

that has drummers talking. Concept Maple offers a myriad of today’s most 

popular configurations. Choose from Concept™ Maple or Concept™ Birch shells, 

Then, add toms or bass drums to build a custom kit to suit your musical style.
