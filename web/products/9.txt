Considered by many to be one of the greatest drummers of all time, Pearl's 

Signature Snare drum collaboration with the great Dennis Chambers is a 

celebration of three decades of partnership, and a unique tribute to 

his diverse playing talents.


The 14x5 Pearl Dennis Chambers Signature Snare Drum (DC1450S-N) has 

outstanding sound and tonal dynamics. This Pearl snare drum features a 3mm 

Cast Aluminum shell, SuperHoop II triple-flange counterhoops, SR020 strainer, 

S1420I 20-strand steel snare wires, and an Evans Coated Power Center Reverse 

Dot batter head. The STL100 lugs are placed in a unique configuration, with 

12 lugs on the batter side and 8 lugs on the snare side. This lug configuration 

brings focus to the batter head and centered sensitivity to the overall snare tone. 

The Dennis Chambers Signature Snare is complete with a Milled Black Nickel shell 

finish and Nickel hardware.
