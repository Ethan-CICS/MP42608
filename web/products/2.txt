The THBB10 is an AZ series solid body electric guitar model 

introduced by Ibanez for 2019. 

It is the first Ibanez signature model for American guitarist 

Tim Henson of the instrumental rock band Polyphia. 

It is produced in Indonesia as part of the mid-tier Premium line.


The THBB10 features an American basswood body bolted to a one-piece 

roasted maple neck with a roasted maple fingerboard with 

24 stainless steel frets, acrylic & abalone split block 

position markers and luminescent side dots. 

Components include custom DiMarzio Notorious pickups mounted in a black 

pickguard with a mini-humbucker at the bridge 

and single-coils in the neck and middle positions, 

a T1502 two-point synchronized tremolo bridge, 

a Graph Tech TUSQ nut and an angled output jack. 


It has Gotoh MG-T locking tuning machines with the thumb wheel 

locking mechanism rather than the adjustable height H.A.P.M

locking tuners which are on the other AZ guitars.
