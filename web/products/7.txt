With its high-quality construction and full-throttle sound, the Jackson X

Series Concert Bass CBXNT DX IV is perfect for use across a variety of

genres. A classic set of P/J pickups produce a muscular and rich bass tone,

which is tweakable with an onboard 3-band EQ. A graphite-reinforced Jackson

Speed maple neck with compound-radius laurel fingerboard marries sturdy

construction with light-speed playability, perfect for sliding your fingers

effortlessly up and down the bassâ€™s 24 frets. Plus, a Jackson Bass Bacher IV

string-through-body hardtail bridge delivers a rapid attack and robust

sustain, the perfect accent to round out this heavy-duty workhorse.
