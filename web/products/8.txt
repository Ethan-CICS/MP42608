The Hofner 500/1 Violin Bass was designed by Walter Hofner and launched at

the Frankfurt Music Messe in 1956. It has since gone on to become one of the

most recongisable electric bass guitars in the music world in terms of both

looks and sound.


The Hofner 500/1 'Cavern' Violin Bass takes it's name from the Cavern Club

in Liverpool, England. Opened in 1957 this Club was one of the most important

small clubs in Europe for bands trying to make it big in the Beatboom era. In

1960 the first beat night session was held featuring Rory Storm and the

Hurricanes with Ringo Starr on drums and by mid 1961 the Merseybeat scene was

in full flow with the Beatles and the Cavern Club centre stage.
